# A Note About Time Logs

I'll be completely honest, I completely forgot to update my time logs after week 5. I put a lot of work into this project and I think that's evident through the number of commits and work that's got into this. In total id estimate that I put in 25ish hours into this project, I just, unfortunately, don't have this information in time log form. My apologies for the screw-up.
