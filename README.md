### Problem Statement

As a trans woman buying clothes is a huge hassle. Most clothing brands don't carry clothing that accommodates my body type. I'm not built like a cisgender woman and a lot of clothing made for cisgender woman simply don't fit me correctly. OffWorld clothing aims top provide clothing for trans people of all body types and walks of life at affordable prices. OffWorld clothes aims to fill a gap in the clothing market that should've been closed 20 years ago selling special made clothes for the trans community.
